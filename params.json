  "body": "#Volca Sample Extender  \r\n\r\nThis program extends the Korg Volca Sample's MIDI functionality. By default the first 10 channels control the sample slots but there is only one channel per sample and without any pitch modification. So it's pretty useless if you want to use a MIDI keyboard. There are already similar projects like this available but I wanted to make my own. Also I use a self written MIDI library, so be warned. \r\n\r\n## Features\r\n* Play samples chromatically in a 4 octave range (MIDI channel 1-10)\r\n* Play all the samples via notes on one channel from C-AS (MIDI channel 16)\r\n* Pitch bend is translated to control the EG INT pitch parameter\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n* Clone this repository\r\n* Clone the [BACH1 library](https://github.com/derdogan/bach1) to lib/bach1\r\n* Compile and upload to Arduino Uno (with the default IDE or PlatformIO)\r\n\r\n## Schematics\r\n### Parts:\r\n* 2x MIDI connector\r\n* optocoupler IC, e.g. the 6N138\r\n* resistors\r\n** 2x 220 Ohm\r\n** 1x 480 Ohm\r\n** 1x 10k Ohm\r\n\r\n### MIDI IN  -> RX (digital pin 0)\r\nConnect the MIDI input to an optocoupler to prevent ground loops.\r\n\r\n![MIDI Input schematics](http://i.imgur.com/Ew5b6qE.jpg)\r\n\r\n### MIDI OUT  -> TX (digital pin 1)\r\nThe output is simpler: All you need is an 220 Ohm resistor.\r\n\r\n![MIDI Input schematics](http://i.imgur.com/fK5Aqsk.jpg)\r\n\r\n## Credits\r\nSpecial thanks to\r\n* Mauricio Maisterrena for the idea and his [code](https://github.com/mmaisterrena/Volca_Simple).\r\n* amandaghassaei for the MIDI I/O schematics and [this instructables page](http://www.instructables.com/id/Send-and-Receive-MIDI-with-Arduino/?ALLSTEPS) about the Arduino and MIDI.\r\n",
